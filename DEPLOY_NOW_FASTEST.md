# ⚡ FASTEST DEPLOY - 30 Seconds!

## ✅ Your Build is Ready!

The `dist` folder is built and contains your latest code with all fixes!

## 🚀 Deploy NOW (3 Steps):

### Step 1: Open Netlify Drop
Go to: **https://app.netlify.com/drop**

### Step 2: Open Your dist Folder
Navigate to: `C:\Users\jacky\OneDrive\Desktop\RF_PRICING_DASHBOARD\dist`

### Step 3: Drag & Drop
- Drag the entire `dist` folder
- Drop it on the Netlify page

## 🔗 Or Use Your Existing Site:

If you already have a Netlify site:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Click your site name
3. Go to **"Deploys"** tab
4. Click **"Drag and drop to deploy"**
5. Drag your `dist` folder
6. **Done!**

## ⚠️ Why CLI Was Slow:

The Netlify CLI command was waiting for:
- Login authentication
- Site selection
- Interactive prompts

**Drag & drop is 10x faster!** No setup needed.

---

## ✅ After Deploy:

1. Your site will be live immediately
2. All your fixes are included
3. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R

---

## 🔧 Fix GitHub Connection Later:

After manual deploy works:
1. Netlify → Site settings → Build & deploy
2. Link to Git provider → GitHub
3. Future pushes will auto-deploy

**But for now, drag & drop is fastest!** ⚡
